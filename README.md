# Iris Species Classification

### Project Overview
The Iris Species Classification project uses a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The project uses the Iris dataset and a Random Forest Classifier to predict species based on sepal and petal measurements.

### Project Structure
- `iris_model.py`: Contains the code for loading, training, and predicting iris species.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `sklearn`


 How It Works:
    - The function `predict_species` takes input data (sepal and petal measurements), and uses the trained model to predict the species.
